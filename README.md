# Pyber Analysis
## Project Overview
Display an overview of the ride sharing data that evaluates attributes by the type of the city. Enhance the overview with visualization to be submitted for business planning and strategies. 

Process:
1. Create a summary table categorized by type of city.
2. Create a table to display the break down of rides by total weekly fares with visualizations.

## Resources:
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook

### Results

The summary table shows that Pyber is being utilized quite differently depending on the type of city. Rural areas have the least number of rides with the highest average fare per driver. Urban areas have the largest number of rides and is most saturated with driver. The pie chart gives a clearer picture of the proportions.

The pie charts show the discrepencies between the driver to rider ration. In the suburbs and the rural areas, riders are experience a wait time due to the lack of drivers where as the urban driver are the group experiencing the wait. From the total fares base on the week and the summary table we see that there is highest profit area is the urban sector.

There are quite a few areas Pyber can increase their marketshare and profits. Within the urban areas, further research needs to be done on the ridership to evaluate what marketing the urbanites would increase ridership. For the suburbs, drivers incentives should be addressed to increase the proportion of the driver-rider ration. For the rural area, the rides should be evaluated by type. For example, in the rural area is the service being used for airport trips? To manage demand in these areas a scheduled ride option might mitigate any discontent from wait times.
